# Metro Operations Optimization

## Introduction
Metro Operations Optimization refers to the systematic process of enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of Metro services through data-driven techniques and operational adjustments. This project focuses on optimizing Delhi Metro operations using Python.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to identify key areas where adjustments in train frequencies could significantly improve service levels, reduce wait times, and alleviate overcrowding.

## Dataset
The dataset contains several files with information about Delhi Metro operations:
- **Agency:** Information about the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, including name, URL, and contact details.
- **Calendar:** Service schedules defining the operation days (weekdays, weekends) and valid dates.
- **Routes:** Details of metro routes, including short and long names, type of route, and descriptions.
- **Shapes:** Geographical coordinates of routes, providing the precise paths of metro lines.
- **Stop Times:** Timetables for each trip, indicating arrival and departure times at specific stops.
- **Stops:** Locations of metro stops, including latitude and longitude.
- **Trips:** Information linking trips to routes, including trip identifiers and associated route IDs.

## Methodology
The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Plotting Metro Routes:** Visualizing the Delhi Metro network to understand coverage and connectivity.
2. **Analyzing Trip Frequency & Scheduling:** Examining variations in train frequency across different days and time slots.
3. **Examining Stop Connectivity:** Analyzing the distribution of stops and their interconnectivity.
4. **Assessing Route Complexity:** Identifying key transfer points and central hubs by evaluating how many routes pass through each stop.
5. **Service Frequency Analysis:** Examining timing intervals between trips to understand peak and off-peak operations.
6. **Trip Supply Calculation:** Using stop times data to determine the number of trips operating in different time intervals.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Geopandas (for mapping)
- Folium (for interactive maps)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the dataset.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn geopandas folium
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook to analyze and visualize the data.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identification of bottlenecks in metro operations.
- Suggestions for optimizing train frequency based on demand patterns.
- Visualization of metro routes, stop connectivity, and peak-hour analysis.
